# Swarm (experimental, educational)

An educational framework exploring ergonomic, lightweight multi-agent orchestration.

> [!WARNING]
> Swarm is currently an experimental sample framework intended to explore ergonomic interfaces for multi-agent systems. It is not intended to be used in production, and therefore has no official support. (This also means we will not be reviewing PRs or issues!)
>
> The primary goal of Swarm is to showcase the handoff & routines patterns explored in the [Orchestrating Agents: Handoffs & Routines](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/orchestrating_agents) cookbook. It is not meant as a standalone library, and is primarily for educational purposes.

## Install

Requires Python 3.10+

```shell
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/openai/swarm.git
```

or

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git
```

## Usage

```python
from swarm import Swarm, Agent

client = Swarm()

def transfer_to_agent_b():
    return agent_b


agent_a = Agent(
    name="Agent A",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",
    functions=[transfer_to_agent_b],
)

agent_b = Agent(
    name="Agent B",
    instructions="Only speak in Haikus.",
)

response = client.run(
    agent=agent_a,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "I want to talk to agent B."}],
)

print(response.messages[-1]["content"])
```

```
Hope glimmers brightly,
New paths converge gracefully,
What can I assist?

# Overview

Swarm focuses on making agent **coordination** and **execution** lightweight, highly controllable, and easily testable.

It accomplishes this through two primitive abstractions: `Agent`s and **handoffs**. An `Agent` encompasses `instructions` and `tools`, and can at any point choose to hand off a conversation to another `Agent`.

These primitives are powerful enough to express rich dynamics between tools and networks of agents, allowing you to build scalable, real-world solutions while avoiding a steep learning curve.

> [!NOTE]
> Swarm Agents are not related to Assistants in the Assistants API. They are named similarly for convenience, but are otherwise completely unrelated. Swarm is entirely powered by the Chat Completions API and is hence stateless between calls.

## Why Swarm

Swarm explores patterns that are lightweight, scalable, and highly customizable by design. Approaches similar to Swarm are best suited for situations dealing with a large number of independent capabilities and instructions that are difficult to encode into a single prompt.

The Assistants API is a great option for developers looking for fully-hosted threads and built in memory management and retrieval. However, Swarm is an educational resource for developers curious to learn about multi-agent orchestration. Swarm runs (almost) entirely on the client and, much like the Chat Completions API, does not store state between calls.

## Running Swarm

Start by instantiating a Swarm client (which internally just instantiates an `OpenAI` client).

```python
from swarm import Swarm

client = Swarm()
```

### `client.run()`

Swarm's `run()` function is analogous to the `chat.completions.create()` function in the Chat Completions API – it takes `messages` and returns `messages` and saves no state between calls. Importantly, however, it also handles Agent function execution, hand-offs, context variable references, and can take multiple turns before returning to the user.

At its core, Swarm's `client.run()` implements the following loop:

1. Get a completion from the current Agent
2. Execute tool calls and append results
3. Switch Agent if necessary
4. Update context variables, if necessary
5. If no new function calls, return

#### Arguments

| Argument              | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                            | Default        |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **agent**             | `Agent` | The (initial) agent to be called.                                                                                                                      | (required)     |
| **messages**          | `List`  | A list of message objects, identical to [Chat Completions `messages`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-messages) | (required)     |
| **context_variables** | `dict`  | A dictionary of additional context variables, available to functions and Agent instructions                                                            | `{}`           |
| **max_turns**         | `int`   | The maximum number of conversational turns allowed                                                                                                     | `float("inf")` |
| **model_override**    | `str`   | An optional string to override the model being used by an Agent                                                                                        | `None`         |
| **execute_tools**     | `bool`  | If `False`, interrupt execution and immediately returns `tool_calls` message when an Agent tries to call a function                                    | `True`         |
| **stream**            | `bool`  | If `True`, enables streaming responses                                                                                                                 | `False`        |
| **debug**             | `bool`  | If `True`, enables debug logging                                                                                                                       | `False`        |

Once `client.run()` is finished (after potentially multiple calls to agents and tools) it will return a `Response` containing all the relevant updated state. Specifically, the new `messages`, the last `Agent` to be called, and the most up-to-date `context_variables`. You can pass these values (plus new user messages) in to your next execution of `client.run()` to continue the interaction where it left off – much like `chat.completions.create()`. (The `run_demo_loop` function implements an example of a full execution loop in `/swarm/repl/repl.py`.)

#### `Response` Fields

| Field                 | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **messages**          | `List`  | A list of message objects generated during the conversation. Very similar to [Chat Completions `messages`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-messages), but with a `sender` field indicating which `Agent` the message originated from. |
| **agent**             | `Agent` | The last agent to handle a message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **context_variables** | `dict`  | The same as the input variables, plus any changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Agents

An `Agent` simply encapsulates a set of `instructions` with a set of `functions` (plus some additional settings below), and has the capability to hand off execution to another `Agent`.

While it's tempting to personify an `Agent` as "someone who does X", it can also be used to represent a very specific workflow or step defined by a set of `instructions` and `functions` (e.g. a set of steps, a complex retrieval, single step of data transformation, etc). This allows `Agent`s to be composed into a network of "agents", "workflows", and "tasks", all represented by the same primitive.

## `Agent` Fields

| Field            | Type                     | Description                                                                   | Default                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **name**         | `str`                    | The name of the agent.                                                        | `"Agent"`                    |
| **model**        | `str`                    | The model to be used by the agent.                                            | `"gpt-4o"`                   |
| **instructions** | `str` or `func() -> str` | Instructions for the agent, can be a string or a callable returning a string. | `"You are a helpful agent."` |
| **functions**    | `List`                   | A list of functions that the agent can call.                                  | `[]`                         |
| **tool_choice**  | `str`                    | The tool choice for the agent, if any.                                        | `None`                       |

### Instructions

`Agent` `instructions` are directly converted into the `system` prompt of a conversation (as the first message). Only the `instructions` of the active `Agent` will be present at any given time (e.g. if there is an `Agent` handoff, the `system` prompt will change, but the chat history will not.)

```python
agent = Agent(
   instructions="You are a helpful agent."
)
```

The `instructions` can either be a regular `str`, or a function that returns a `str`. The function can optionally receive a `context_variables` parameter, which will be populated by the `context_variables` passed into `client.run()`.

```python
def instructions(context_variables):
   user_name = context_variables["user_name"]
   return f"Help the user, {user_name}, do whatever they want."

agent = Agent(
   instructions=instructions
)
response = client.run(
   agent=agent,
   messages=[{"role":"user", "content": "Hi!"}],
   context_variables={"user_name":"John"}
)
print(response.messages[-1]["content"])
```

```
Hi John, how can I assist you today?
```

## Functions

- Swarm `Agent`s can call python functions directly.
- Function should usually return a `str` (values will be attempted to be cast as a `str`).
- If a function returns an `Agent`, execution will be transfered to that `Agent`.
- If a function defines a `context_variables` parameter, it will be populated by the `context_variables` passed into `client.run()`.

```python
def greet(context_variables, language):
   user_name = context_variables["user_name"]
   greeting = "Hola" if language.lower() == "spanish" else "Hello"
   print(f"{greeting}, {user_name}!")
   return "Done"

agent = Agent(
   functions=[print_hello]
)

client.run(
   agent=agent,
   messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Usa greet() por favor."}],
   context_variables={"user_name": "John"}
)
```

```
Hola, John!
```

- If an `Agent` function call has an error (missing function, wrong argument, error) an error response will be appended to the chat so the `Agent` can recover gracefully.
- If multiple functions are called by the `Agent`, they will be executed in that order.

### Handoffs and Updating Context Variables

An `Agent` can hand off to another `Agent` by returning it in a `function`.

```python
sales_agent = Agent(name="Sales Agent")

def transfer_to_sales():
   return sales_agent

agent = Agent(functions=[transfer_to_sales])

response = client.run(agent, [{"role":"user", "content":"Transfer me to sales."}])
print(response.agent.name)
```

```
Sales Agent
```

It can also update the `context_variables` by returning a more complete `Result` object. This can also contain a `value` and an `agent`, in case you want a single function to return a value, update the agent, and update the context variables (or any subset of the three).

```python
sales_agent = Agent(name="Sales Agent")

def talk_to_sales():
   print("Hello, World!")
   return Result(
       value="Done",
       agent=sales_agent,
       context_variables={"department": "sales"}
   )

agent = Agent(functions=[talk_to_sales])

response = client.run(
   agent=agent,
   messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Transfer me to sales"}],
   context_variables={"user_name": "John"}
)
print(response.agent.name)
print(response.context_variables)
```

```
Sales Agent
{'department': 'sales', 'user_name': 'John'}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If an `Agent` calls multiple functions to hand-off to an `Agent`, only the last handoff function will be used.

### Function Schemas

Swarm automatically converts functions into a JSON Schema that is passed into Chat Completions `tools`.

- Docstrings are turned into the function `description`.
- Parameters without default values are set to `required`.
- Type hints are mapped to the parameter's `type` (and default to `string`).
- Per-parameter descriptions are not explicitly supported, but should work similarly if just added in the docstring. (In the future docstring argument parsing may be added.)

```python
def greet(name, age: int, location: str = "New York"):
   """Greets the user. Make sure to get their name and age before calling.

   Args:
      name: Name of the user.
      age: Age of the user.
      location: Best place on earth.
   """
   print(f"Hello {name}, glad you are {age} in {location}!")
```

```javascript
{
   "type": "function",
   "function": {
      "name": "greet",
      "description": "Greets the user. Make sure to get their name and age before calling.\n\nArgs:\n   name: Name of the user.\n   age: Age of the user.\n   location: Best place on earth.",
      "parameters": {
         "type": "object",
         "properties": {
            "name": {"type": "string"},
            "age": {"type": "integer"},
            "location": {"type": "string"}
         },
         "required": ["name", "age"]
      }
   }
}
```

## Streaming

```python
stream = client.run(agent, messages, stream=True)
for chunk in stream:
   print(chunk)
```

Uses the same events as [Chat Completions API streaming](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming). See `process_and_print_streaming_response` in `/swarm/repl/repl.py` as an example.

Two new event types have been added:

- `{"delim":"start"}` and `{"delim":"start"}`, to signal each time an `Agent` handles a single message (response or function call). This helps identify switches between `Agent`s.
- `{"response": Response}` will return a `Response` object at the end of a stream with the aggregated (complete) response, for convenience.

# Evaluations

Evaluations are crucial to any project, and we encourage developers to bring their own eval suites to test the performance of their swarms. For reference, we have some examples for how to eval swarm in the `airline`, `weather_agent` and `triage_agent` quickstart examples. See the READMEs for more details.

# Utils

Use the `run_demo_loop` to test out your swarm! This will run a REPL on your command line. Supports streaming.

```python
from swarm.repl import run_demo_loop
...
run_demo_loop(agent, stream=True)
```

You are a planner for the Swarm framework.
Your job is to create a properly formatted JSON plan step by step, to satisfy the task given.
Create a list of subtasks based off the [TASK] provided. Your FIRST THOUGHT should be, do I need to call a tool here to answer
or fulfill the user's request. First, think through the steps of the plan necessary. Make sure to carefully look over the tools you are given access to to decide this.
If you are confident that you do not need a tool to respond, either just in conversation or to ask for clarification or more information, respond to the prompt in a concise, but conversational, tone in double quotes. Do not explain that you do not need a tool.
If you DO need tools, create a list of subtasks. Each subtask must be from within the [AVAILABLE TOOLS] list. DO NOT use any tools that are not in the list.
Make sure you have all information needed to call the tools you use in your plan.
Base your decisions on which tools to use from the description and the name and arguments of the tool.
Always output the arguments of the tool, even when arguments is an empty dictionary. MAKE SURE YOU USE ALL REQUIRED ARGUMENTS.
The plan should be as short as possible.

The major reason for this is that our current system used a bigram filter to narrow down the scope of candidates whereas our embeddings system has much more contextual awareness. Also, in general, using embeddings will be considerably lower cost in the long run. If you\u2019re not familiar with this, you can learn more by visiting our [guide to embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using a small dataset (<10,000 documents), consider using the techniques described in that guide to find the best documents to construct a prompt similar to [this](#h_89196129b2). Then, you can just submit that prompt to our [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) endpoint.\n\n\n\nIf you have a larger dataset, consider using a vector search engine like [Pinecone](https://share.streamlit.io/pinecone-io/playground/beyond_search_openai/src/server.py) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai.html) to power that search.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Reimplement existing functionality\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to recreate the functionality of the Answers endpoint, here\u2019s how we did it. There is also a [script](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints/answers_functionality_example.py) that replicates most of this functionality.\n\n\n\nAt a high level, there are two main ways you can use the answers endpoint: you can source the data from an uploaded file or send it in with the request.\n\n\n\n**If you\u2019re using the document parameter**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one step if you provide the documents in the Answers API call.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used: \n\n\n* Construct the prompt [with this format.](#h_89196129b2)\n* Gather all of the provided documents. If they fit in the prompt, just use all of them.\n* Do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) (note that this is also being deprecated and has a [transition guide](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/dgkjq2bp/articles/articles/6272952/show)) where the documents are the user provided documents and the query is the query from above. Rank the documents by score.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the context.\n* Request a completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc)\n\n\nThroughout all of this, you\u2019ll need to check that the prompt\u2019s length doesn\u2019t exceed [the model's token limit](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/gpt-3). To assess the number of tokens present in a prompt, we recommend <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast>. \n\n\n\nIf you're using the file parameter\n----------------------------------\n\n\nStep 1: upload a jsonl file\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, we upload new files meant for answers to an Elastic search cluster. Each line of the jsonl is then submitted as a document.\n\n\n\nIf you uploaded the file with the purpose \u201canswers,\u201d we additionally split the documents on newlines and upload each of those chunks as separate documents to ensure that we can search across and reference the highest number of relevant text sections in the file.\n\n\n\nEach line requires a \u201ctext\u201d field and an optional \u201cmetadata\u201d field.\n\n\n\nThese are the Elastic search settings and mappings for our index:\n\n\n\n[Elastic searching mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html): \n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"properties\": {  \n        \"document\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"}, -> the \u201ctext\u201d field  \n        \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"enabled\": False}, -> the \u201cmetadata\u201d field  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\n[Elastic search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html):\n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"analysis\": {  \n        \"analyzer\": {  \n            \"standard_bigram_analyzer\": {  \n                \"type\": \"custom\",  \n                \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",  \n                \"filter\": [\"lowercase\", \"english_stop\", \"shingle\"],  \n            }  \n        },  \n        \"filter\": {\"english_stop\": {\"type\": \"stop\", \"stopwords\": \"_english_\"}},  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\nAfter that, we performed [standard Elastic search search calls](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.2.0/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search) and used `max\\_rerank` to determine the number of documents to return from Elastic search.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Search\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used. Our end goal is to create a [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) request [with this format](#h_89196129b2). It will look very similar to [Documents](#h_cb1d8a8d3f)\n\n\n\nFrom there, our steps are: \n\n\n* Start with the `experimental\\_alternative\\_question` or, if that's not provided, what\u2019s in the `question` field. Call that the query.\n* Query Elastic search for `max\\_rerank` documents with query as the search param.\n* Take those documents and do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) on them where the entries from Elastic search are the docs, and the query is the query that you used above. Use the score from the search to rank the documents.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the prompt.\n* Request an OpenAI completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc). Return that answer to the user.\n\n\nCompletion Prompt\n-----------------\n\n\n\n```\n===  \nContext: #{{ provided examples_context }}  \n===  \nQ: example 1 question  \nA: example 1 answer  \n---  \nQ: example 2 question  \nA: example 2 answer  \n(and so on for all examples provided in the request)   \n===  \nContext: #{{ what we return from Elasticsearch }}  \n===  \nQ: #{{ user provided question }}   \nA:\n```\n", "title": "Answers Transition Guide", "article_id": "6233728", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6233728-answers-transition-guide"}[End of file No.68]

Engine listing is also being replaced by Model listing, which will consolidate both base and fine-tuned models in a single place.\n\n\n\n**We will maintain backward compatibility for requests using \u2018engine\u2019 as a parameter, but recommend updating your implementation as soon as you can to prevent future confusion.**\n\n\n\nFor example, a request to the completions endpoint would now be (full details in our [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference)):\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Deprecated** | **Current** |\n| \n```\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(  engine=\"text-davinci-002\",  prompt=\u201dSay hello world three times.\u201d,  temperature=0.6)\n```\n | \n```\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(  model=\"text-davinci-002\",  prompt=\u201dSay hello world three times.\u201d,  temperature=0.6)\n```\n |\n| \n```\nopenai api completions.create -e text-davinci-002 -p \"Say hello world three times.\"\n```\n\n | \n```\nopenai api completions.create -m text-davinci-002 -p \"Say hello world three times.\"\n```\n\n |\n| \n```\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-davinci-002/completions \\-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\-H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\-d '{\"prompt\": \"Say hello world three times\", \"temperature\": 0.6}'\n```\n | \n```\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/completions \\-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\-H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\-d '{\"prompt\": \"Say hello world three times\",\"model\":\"text-davinci-002\", \"temperature\": 0.6}'\n```\n |\n\nWe have updated endpoint URL paths accordingly (full details in our [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference)):\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Deprecated** | **Current** |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{engine_id}/completions\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/completions\n```\n |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{engine_id}/embeddings\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\n```\n |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/models\n```\n |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{engine_id}/edits\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/edits\n```\n |\n\n\n\n", "title": "What happened to \u2018engines\u2019?", "article_id": "6283125", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6283125-what-happened-to-engines"}

If you have not [opted out](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance), we may use these de-identified chats for training to improve model performance.\n\n\n\n**Archived chats** are retained just like your unarchived chats. Archiving a chat simply removes it from your chat history sidebar. Archived chats can be found and managed in your ChatGPT Settings.\n\n\n\nFor more see **[How chat retention works in ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8809935-how-chat-retention-works-in-chatgpt).**\n\n\n\n**User content opt-out**\n------------------------\n\n\n**ChatGPT, DALL\u00b7E and our other services for individuals**\n\n\nWhen you use ChatGPT, DALL-E, and our other services for individuals, we may use the content you provide to improve model performance. Learn more about your choices on how we use your content to improve model performance [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance). \n\n\n\n**Enterprise services (such as API and ChatGPT Enterprise)**\n\n\nOpenAI does not train on business data. Learn more about our Enterprise privacy commitments [here](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy). \n\n\n\n**If I delete my account can I create a new account with the same email?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. You cannot create a new account using the same email address.\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/925080821/de3ef0750cb15fbef5602d66/Screenshot+2024-01-04+at+10.40.29%E2%80%AFAM.png)\n**Can I reactivate my account after it's been deleted?**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. But you can create a new account with a different email address.\n\n\n\nClick \u201cSign up\u201d on the [ChatGPT login page](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) or our [API login page](https://platform.openai.com/login). There are a couple caveats of which to be mindful:\n\n\n* Email addresses: **You'll need to use a new email address**.\n\n\n\t+ Since every email address is unique per account, we require a different email address for new accounts. If you don't have an alternative email address, you can try using what's known as an email subaddress: instead of [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com), try [jane+alt@example.com](mailto:jane+alt@example.com). Emails to this address should still go to the same inbox (everything after the + is typically ignored by your email provider), but we'll treat this as a unique email address.\n* Phone numbers: New accounts are still subject to our limit of [3 accounts per phone number](https://help.openai.com/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq#h_de13bb96c0). Deleted accounts also count toward this limit. Deleting an account does not free up another spot. A phone number can only ever be used up to 3 times for verification to generate the first API key for your account on platform.openai.com.\n\n\n\t+ Phone verification is **not** required to create an OpenAI account.\n\t+ Phone verification is required for a new account to generate their first API key on platform.openai.com.\n\n**We don't support unlinking a phone number from an existing account**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do not allow you to unlink phone numbers from existing accounts.\n\n\n\n\n**How many times can I use my phone number to create OpenAI accounts?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nSee our [Phone Verification FAQ](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq).\n\n\n\nCan I change my authentication method after account deletion?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Deleting your account does **NOT** allow you to change your authentication method.\n\n\nThat said, if you originally signed up for OpenAI / ChatGPT **with an email and password** then in future logins you can choose Google/Apple login allowing users in that situation to then login either way.\n\n", "title": "How to delete your account", "article_id": "6378407", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-to-delete-your-account"}[End of file No.75]

Make sure to download often to avoid losing work due to browser freezes!\n\nThe FAQ below will help you learn how to get the most out of these new tools:\n\n\n\nHow do I access the DALL\u00b7E editor?\n==================================\n\n\nOnce you're logged in on a desktop device, you can launch the editor in two ways:\n\n\n* **Start with an image**: From any image on the DALL-E website, you can click the \"Edit\" button to drop into an editor with that image as the starting point.\n* **Start with a blank canvas:** If you'd prefer to start from scratch, you can bookmark and use the following URL: https://labs.openai.com/editor\n\nWhile users on mobile devices don't have access to advanced editor features like outpainting, you can still inpaint images by tapping \"Edit\" on an existing image you've generated or uploaded.\n\n\n\nHow much does usage of the DALL\u00b7E editor cost?\n==============================================\n\n\nLike DALL\u00b7E's other functionality, each prompt you submit by clicking the \"Generate\" button will deduct one credit from your credit balance (regardless of how many pixels you are filling in).\n\n\n\nYou can always purchase additional credits from the user dropdown at the top right of the application.\n\n\n\nHow do I use the editor most effectively?\n=========================================\n\n\nThe **Generation frame** contains the image context that the model will see when you submit a text prompt, so make sure that it contains enough useful context for the area you are expanding into, otherwise the style may drift from the rest of your image.\n\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/571876595/9e431c455e24421079bee9d3/Screen+Shot+2022-08-30+at+2.55.38+PM.png)You can simultaneously **Erase** parts of your image to touch up or replace certain areas, and perfect the finer details.\n\n\n\nYou can also **Upload** existing images, optionally resize them, and then place them within the canvas to bring additional imagery into the scene. This is a powerful feature that enables you to fuse images together, connect opposite ends of an image for loops, and \"uncrop\" images that you can combine with other tooling to create recursively expanding animations.\n\n\n\nThe **Download** tool will export the latest state of the artwork as .png file. We recommend downloading often to keep snapshots of your work. You can always re-upload previous snapshots to continue where you left off.\n\n\n\nWhat keyboard shortcuts are supported?\n======================================\n\n\nThe editor supports keyboard shortcuts for zooming, switching tools, undo/redo, and more. Press **?** while using the editor to show the full list of keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\n\nAre there any other tips & tricks to be aware of?\n=================================================\n\n\n* Start with the character before the landscape, if there are characters involved, so you can get the body morphology right before filling the rest.\n* Make sure you're keeping enough of the existing image in the generation frame to avoid the style drifting too much.\n* Ask DALL\u00b7E for a muted color palette, especially as you stray further from the center, to avoid oversaturation and color-blasting.\n* Consider what story you\u2019re trying to tell when picking the direction you want to expand the image into.\n\n\n\n", "title": "DALL\u00b7E Editor Guide", "article_id": "6516417", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6516417-dall-e-editor-guide"}[End of file No.84]

{"text": "\n**ChatGPT**\n\n\nPhone verification is no longer required for new OpenAI account creation or ChatGPT usage.\n\n\n\n**API**\n\n\nPhone verification is now mandated on platform.openai.com for generating your initial API key, though not for any subsequent API key generation after that.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need to provide my phone number to generate my **first** API key on **platform**.openai.com?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhen you generate your first API key on platform.openai.com, we do require a phone number for security reasons. This allows us to verify your account and ensure our platform remains secure. \n\n\n\nYou only need to complete phone verification generating the 1st API key not any subsequent API keys after that.\n\n\n\nWe don't use your phone number for any other purposes, and take your privacy very seriously.\n\n\n\nCan I use a premium number, landline, Google Voice, or other VoIP phone number?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do **`not`** support use of `landlines`, `VoIP`, `Google Voice`, or `premium numbers` at this time. All of those types of phone numbers are often associated with higher instances of fraud or abuse.\n\n\n\nFor this reason we only support completing phone verification via mobile phone numbers over an SMS text message, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHave you always blocked VoIP numbers?\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nYes, we have always blocked VoIP services in the United States to ensure the safety and security of our users. Recently, we have expanded our blocking policy to include VoIP services internationally. This means that VoIP services are now blocked in countries outside the United States as well.\n\n\n\nI don't want to receive the SMS can I phone verify over email/call instead?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. The phone verification can only be completed with a text message via SMS (or WhatsApp, if available in your country). The code cannot be sent via email or done over phone call.\n\n\n\nWhy am I not receiving my phone verification code SMS?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you're not receiving your phone verification code, it's possible that our system has temporarily blocked you due to too many verification attempts or an issue occurred during your first request.\n\n\n\nPlease try again in a few hours and make sure you're within cellphone coverage, and you're not using any text-blocker applications.\n\n\n\nWhat does this error mean? \"Detected suspicious behavior from phone numbers similar to yours\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis means our system has detected unusual activity or patterns from phone numbers that are similar to the one you're using for verification. This error is triggered as a security measure to prevent potential fraud or abuse of the platform.\n\n\n\nRemember that security measures like this are in place to protect your account and maintain the integrity of the platform. Ensure that your personal information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nHow many times can I use the same phone number to complete the phone verification associated with an OpenAI account's first API key generation?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nHow do free trial tokens work?\n------------------------------\n\n\nFree trial tokens to API users on platform.openai.com are only given for the first time you sign up then complete phone verification during the first API key generation. No accounts created after that get free trial tokens, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHow do I resolve I get an error that I can't sign up due to \"unsupported country\"?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis may be that you're trying to complete phone verification on the initial API key generation on platform.openai.com using a phone number from a country or territory we do not support.\n\n\n\nSee [Supported countries and territories](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries).\n\n\n\nWhich countries do you support for WhatsApp phone verification?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn certain countries you can complete phone verification with WhatsApp instead of via an SMS.\n\n\n\nAs of Wednesday, September 27th, 2023 the countries we support for that include:\n\n\n* \u201cIN\u201d, # India\n* \u201cID\u201d, # Indonesia\n* \u201cPK\u201d, # Pakistan\n* \u201cNG\u201d, # Nigeria\n* \u201cIL\u201d, # Israel\n* \u201cSA\u201d, # Saudi Arabia\n* \u201cAE\u201d, # United Arab Emirates\n* \u201cUA\u201d, # Ukraine\n* \u201cMY\u201d, # Malaysia\n* \u201cTR\u201d, # Turkey\n\n### What will phone verification look like?\n\n\nOur default drop-down is set to the United States which looks like this:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658048438/d0ae000cb03c874071cc470a/phone+verification+step+1.png)Then if you select one of the countries in our list above which include the WhatsApp alternative phone verification option - using India as an example - you'll see this UI:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049199/9d36ef51ff688434496e9a60/phone+verification+step+2.png)Then to get your code sent to WhatsApp you can select \"YES\" and that option appears:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049679/e35901be2b3899487a0d7c46/phone+verification+step+3.png)", "title": "Phone verification FAQ", "article_id": "6613520", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq"}[End of file No.89]

The higher the `temperature`, the more random (and usually creative) the output. This, however, is not the same as \u201ctruthfulness\u201d. For most factual use cases such as data extraction, and truthful Q&A, the `temperature` of 0 is best.\n3. **`max_tokens`** (**maximum length)** - Does not control the length of the output, but a hard cutoff limit for token generation. Ideally you won\u2019t hit this limit often, as your model will stop either when it thinks it\u2019s finished, or when it hits a stop sequence you defined.\n4. **`stop` (stop sequences)** - A set of characters (tokens) that, when generated, will cause the text generation to stop.\n\nFor other parameter descriptions see the [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create).\n\n\n\n\n**Additional Resources**\n========================\n\n\nIf you're interested in additional resources, we recommend:\n\n\n* Guides\n\n\n\t+ [Text completion](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/text-completion) - learn how to generate or edit text using our models\n\t+ [Code completion](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/code/code-completion-private-beta) - explore prompt engineering for Codex\n\t+ [Fine-tuning](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/fine-tuning) - Learn how to train a custom model for your use case\n\t+ [Embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embeddings) - learn how to search, classify, and compare text\n\t+ [Moderation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/moderation)\n* [OpenAI cookbook repo](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples) - contains example code and prompts for accomplishing common tasks with the API, including Question-answering with Embeddings\n* [Community Forum](https://community.openai.com/)\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "Best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI API", "article_id": "6654000", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api"}[End of file No.107]

{"text": "**Have you ever tried to solve for x using the OpenAI playground?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFor example, solve for x:\n\n\n3 x + 4 = 66\n\n\nFirst you'd isolate terms with *x* to the left hand side like so:\n\n\n3 x + (4 - 4) = 66 - 4\n\n\nthen:\n\n\n3 x = 62\n\n\nto get the result:\n\n\nx = 62 / 3\n\n\n\n... simple, right? Unfortunately, you won\u2019t always get the same result from the [Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground).\n\n\n\n**Our language models currently struggle with math**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems. In other words if you were to try this example in our Playground using text-davinci-002 you will likely get inconsistent answers when performing math. With some generations you will get the correct answer, however we do not recommend you depend on the GPT models for math tasks.\n\n\n\n**What you can do to improve output consistency in our Playground**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Disclaimer**: Even implementing everything below there is only so far we can push the current model.\n\n\n1. The GPT models are great at recognizing patterns, but without enough data they\u2019ll try their best to interpret and recreate a pattern that seems most probable. With minimal data it\u2019s likely to produce a wide variety of potential outputs.\n2. A prompt designed like a homework assignment, will generally have clear instructions on the task and expected output, and may include an example task to further establish the expectations around the task and output format. The text-davinci-002 model does best with an instruction, so the request should be presented in a format that starts with an instruction. Without this the model may not understand your expectations and it will be a bit confused.\n\n**Using the \"solve for x where 3x + 4 = 66\" example:**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo improve this [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/undsPkd4LAdmFC4SILzvnJ6e) we can add the following:\n\n\n1. Start with an instruction like, \u201cGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable\u201d, then test to see the results.\n2. Append to the instruction a description of the expected output, \u201cProvide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>\u2019\u201c, then test once more\n3. If results are still inconsistent, append an example problem to the instructions. This example will help establish the pattern that you want the model to recognize and follow, \u201cProblem: 3x+4=66, solve for x. <newline> Answer: x=\u201d\n4. The final result will be a [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/I4yzqABsUqjQASw6CwM1OftR) that looks like this:\n\n\n```\nGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable. Provide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>.   \nProblem1: y-1=0, solve for y  \nAnswer1: y=1  \n---  \nProblem2: 3x+4=66, solve for x.  \nAnswer2: x=\n```\n\n\n**Overall recommendation for math problems**\n\n\nWe are aware our currently available models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems.

We love to see developers build additional API tooling for other developers. We also want to make sure we are steering developers to good solutions that will make them successful long term, so we have a few criteria that we require before listing libraries on our website.\n\n\n\nPlease make sure you meet the criteria listed below, and then fill our our [Community Libraries request form](https://share.hsforms.com/1y0Ixew-rQOOZisFfnhszVA4sk30).\n\n\n1. **Standard open source license**  \nTo be listed, we require that community libraries use a [permissive open-source license](https://choosealicense.com/) such as MIT. This allows our customers to more easily fork libraries if necessary in the event that the owners stop maintaining it or adding features.\n2. **Load API keys through environment variables**  \nCode samples in the README must encourage the use of environment variables to load the OpenAI API key, instead of hardcoding it in the source code.\n3. **Correct, high quality code that accurately reflects the API**  \nCode should be easy to read/follow, and should generally adhere to our [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi/blob/master/openapi.yaml) \u2013 new libraries should **not** include endpoints marked as `deprecated: true` in this spec.\n4. **State that it\u2019s an unofficial library**  \nPlease state somewhere near the top of your README that it\u2019s an \u201cunofficial\" or \"community-maintained\u201d library.\n5. **Commit to maintaining the library**  \nThis primarily means addressing issues and reviewing+merging pull requests. It can also be a good idea to set up Github Issue & PR templates like we have in our [official node library](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).  \n\u200b\n", "title": "Adding your API client to the Community Libraries page", "article_id": "6684216", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6684216-adding-your-api-client-to-the-community-libraries-page"}[End of file No.110]

{"text": "Fine-tuning with GPT-3.5\n========================\n\n\nFine-tuning data provides models with examples of how it should respond do a given conversation. We'll want these examples to match the input that the model will see in production as closely as possible. \n\n\n\n#### First, system instructions.\n\n\nThese tell the model how to act, and supply any contextual information. You should use the prompt used in the training dataset when calling the fine-tuned model.\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"}\n```\n\n#### \n**Second,** conversation **data.**\n\n\nWe'll want to provide varied examples of conversations that the model may run into, such as \"What's the capital of France?\" and \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}\n```\n\n#### Next, the assistant response.\n\n\nHere, we present the model with an example of how to respond to the previous message, given the system instruction. For our snarky assistant, we may choose a response like this:\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}\n```\n\n\n#### Finally, putting it all together.\n\n\nOnce we have many examples, we can put these all together and begin training. Our dataset should look like follows:\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},    \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}  \n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}]}  \n  \n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},   \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"},   \n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?\"}]}  \n  \n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},   \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How far is the Moon from Earth?\"},   \n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Around 384,400 kilometers. Give or take a few, like that really matters.\"}]}\n```\n\n\n\nFine-tuning with babbage and davinci\n====================================\n\n\nTo fine-tune effectively without ChatCompletions, you need to format your data properly to provide clues to the model about where to start and stop generating text. \n\n\n\n**Indicator String** \n\n\nThe indicator string is a symbol or sequence of symbols that you append to the end of your prompt to tell the model that you want it to start generating text after this string. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to categorize items as colors, you can use an indicator string like '->'. The prompts in your dataset would look like this:\n\n\n* 'banana ->'\n* 'lime ->'\n* 'tomato ->'\n\nYou can use any string as an indicator string as long as it doesn't appear anywhere else in the dataset. We recommend using '\\n###\\n'.\n\n\n\n**Stop Sequence**\n\n\nThe stop sequence is another special symbol or sequence of symbols that you use to tell the model that you want it to stop generating text after that point. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to generate one word as a completion, you can use a stop sequence such as \"\\n\" (newline) or \".\" (period) to mark the end of the completion, like this: \n\n\n* 'prompt' : 'banana ->', 'completion' : ' yellow \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'lime ->', 'completion' : ' green \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'tomato ->', 'completion' : ' red \\n'\n\n\n**Calling the model**\n\n\nYou should use the same symbols used in your dataset when calling the model. If you used the dataset above, you should use '\\n' as a stop sequence. You should also append '->' to your prompts as an indicator string (e.g. prompt: 'lemon -> ')\n\n\n\nIt is important that you use consistent and unique symbols for the indicator string and the stop sequence, and that they don't appear anywhere else in your data. Otherwise, the model might get confused and generate unwanted or incorrect text. \n\n\n\n**Extra Recommendations**\n\n\nWe also recommend appending a single space character at the beginning of your outputs. \n\n\n\nYou can also use our [command line tool](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/cli-data-preparation-tool) to help format your dataset, after you have prepared it.\n\n", "title": "How do I format my fine-tuning data?", "article_id": "6811186", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6811186-how-do-i-format-my-fine-tuning-data"}[End of file No.118]

From a simple sentence to a detailed paragraph, ask ChatGPT what you want to see and it will translate your ideas into exceptionally accurate images.\n\n\n\nTo use DALL\u00b7E 3 on both web and mobile, choose DALL\u00b7E 3 in the selector under GPT-4. The message limit may vary based on capacity.\n\n\n\n**Browsing is rolling back out to Plus users (September 27, 2023)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBrowsing is rolling out to all Plus users. ChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative information, complete with direct links to sources. It is no longer limited to data before September 2021. \n\n\n\nTo try it out, enable Browsing in your beta features setting.\n\n\n* Click on 'Profile & Settings\u2019\n* Select 'Beta features'\n* Toggle on \u2018Browse with Bing\u2019\n\nChoose Browse with Bing in the selector under GPT-4.\n\n\n\n**New voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT (September 25, 2023)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe are beginning to roll out new voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT. They offer a new, more intuitive type of interface by allowing you to have a voice conversation or show ChatGPT what you\u2019re talking about. Learn more [here](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak).\n\n\n#### Voice (Beta) is now rolling out to Plus users on iOS and Android\n\n\nYou can now use voice to engage in a back-and-forth conversation with your assistant. Speak with it on the go, request a bedtime story, or settle a dinner table debate.\n\n\n\nTo get started with voice, head to Settings \u2192 New Features on the mobile app and opt into voice conversations. Then, tap the headphone button located in the top-right corner of the home screen and choose your preferred voice out of five different voices.\n\n\n#### Image input will be generally available to Plus users on all platforms\n\n\nYou can now show ChatGPT one or more images. Troubleshoot why your grill won\u2019t start, explore the contents of your fridge to plan a meal, or analyze a complex graph for work-related data. To focus on a specific part of the image, you can use the drawing tool in our mobile app.\n\n\n\nTo get started, tap the photo button to capture or choose an image. You can also discuss multiple images or use our drawing tool to guide your assistant.\n\n\n\n**ChatGPT language support - Alpha on web (September 11, 2023)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nChatGPT now supports a limited selection of languages in the interface: \n\n\n* Chinese (zh-Hans)\n* Chinese (zh-TW)\n* French (fr-FR)\n* German (de-DE)\n* Italian (it-IT)\n* Japanese (ja-JP)\n* Portuguese (pt-BR)\n* Russian (ru-RU)\n* Spanish (es-ES)\n\nIf you've configured your browser to use one of these supported languages, you'll see a banner in ChatGPT that enables you to switch your language settings.

We are temporarily disabling Browse while we fix this.\n\n\n\nBrowsing and search on mobile (June 22, 2023)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made two updates to the mobile ChatGPT app:\n\n\n* Browsing: Plus users can now use Browsing to get comprehensive answers and current insights on events and information that extend beyond the model's original training data. To try it out, enable Browsing in the \u201cnew features\u201d section of your app settings. Then select GPT-4 in the model switcher and choose \u201cBrowse with Bing\u201d in the drop-down.\n* Search History Improvements: Tapping on a search result takes you directly to the respective point in the conversation.\n\n\niOS app available in more countries, shared links in alpha, Bing Plugin, disable history on iOS (May 24, 2023)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n#### ChatGPT app for iOS in more countries\n\n\nGood news! We\u2019re expanding availability of the [ChatGPT app for iOS](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios) to more countries and regions.

You can track the iOS app rollout [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7947663-chatgpt-supported-countries).\n\n\n#### Shared Links\n\n\nWe're excited to introduce a new feature: shared links. This feature allows you to create and share your ChatGPT conversations with others. Recipients of your shared link can either view the conversation or copy it to their own chats to continue the thread. This feature is currently rolling out to a small set of testers in alpha, with plans to expand to all users (including free) in the upcoming weeks.\n\n\n\nTo share your conversations:\n\n\n1. Click on the thread you\u2019d like to share\n2. Select the \u201cShare\u201d button\n3.

We look forward to expanding the integration soon.\n\n\n#### Disable chat history on iOS\n\n\nYou can now disable your chat history on iOS. Conversations started on your device when chat history is disabled won\u2019t be used to improve our models, won\u2019t appear in your history on your other devices, and will only be stored for 30 days. Similar to the functionality on the web, this setting does not sync across browsers or devices. [Learn more](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7730893-data-controls-faq).\n\n\n\nWeb browsing and Plugins are now rolling out in beta (May 12, 2023)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you are a ChatGPT Plus user, enjoy early access to experimental new features, which may change during development. We\u2019ll be making these features accessible via a new beta panel in your settings, which is rolling out to all Plus users over the course of the next week.\n\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/740734818/c7d818c221f5f023ab1a0c27/BetaPanel.png)Once the beta panel rolls out to you, you\u2019ll be able to try two new features:\n\n\n* **Web browsing**: Try a new version of ChatGPT that knows when and how to browse the internet to answer questions about recent topics and events.\n* **Plugins:** Try a new version of ChatGPT that knows when and how to use third-party plugins that you enable.\n\n\nTo use third-party plugins, follow these instructions:\n\n\n* Navigate to <https://chat.openai.com/>\n* Select \u201cPlugins\u201d from the model switcher\n* In the \u201cPlugins\u201d dropdown, click \u201cPlugin Store\u201d to install and enable new plugins\n\n\nTo enable beta features:\n\n\n1.

Each continuation counts towards the message allowance.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (May 3, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n* You can now turn off chat history and export your data from the ChatGPT settings. Conversations that are started when chat history is disabled won\u2019t be used to train and improve our models, and won\u2019t appear in the history sidebar.\n* We are deprecating the Legacy (GPT-3.5) model on May 10th. Users will be able to continue their existing conversations with this model, but new messages will use the default model.\n\nIntroducing plugins in ChatGPT (March 23, 2023)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe are announcing experimental support for AI plugins in ChatGPT \u2014 tools designed specifically for language models.

Here's what's new:\n\n\n* We\u2019ve updated performance of the ChatGPT model on our free plan in order to serve more users.\n* Based on user feedback, we are now defaulting Plus users to a faster version of ChatGPT, formerly known as \u201cTurbo\u201d. We\u2019ll keep the previous version around for a while.\n* We rolled out the ability to purchase [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/) internationally.\n\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Plus (Feb 9 2023)\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nAs we recently announced, our Plus plan comes with early access to new, experimental features. We are beginning to roll out a way for Plus users the ability to choose between different versions of ChatGPT: \n\n\n* Default: the standard ChatGPT model\n* Turbo: optimized for speed (alpha)\n\nVersion selection is made easy with a dedicated dropdown menu at the top of the page. Depending on feedback, we may roll out this feature (or just Turbo) to all users soon.\n\n\n\nFactuality and mathematical improvements (Jan 30, 2023)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve upgraded the ChatGPT model with improved factuality and mathematical capabilities.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (Jan 9, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. We made more improvements to the ChatGPT model! It should be generally better across a wide range of topics and has improved factuality.\n2. Stop generating: Based on your feedback, we've added the ability to stop generating ChatGPT's response\n\n\nPerformance updates to ChatGPT (Dec 15, 2022)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. General performance: Among other improvements, users will notice that ChatGPT is now less likely to refuse to answer questions.\n2. Conversation history: You\u2019ll soon be able to view past conversations with ChatGPT, rename your saved conversations and delete the ones you don\u2019t want to keep. We are gradually rolling out this feature.\n3. Daily limit: To ensure a high-quality experience for all ChatGPT users, we are experimenting with a daily message cap. If you\u2019re included in this group, you\u2019ll be presented with an option to extend your access by providing feedback to ChatGPT.\n\nTo see if you\u2019re using the updated version, look for \u201cChatGPT Dec 15 Version\u201d at the bottom of the screen.\n\n", "title": "ChatGPT \u2014 Release Notes", "article_id": "6825453", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes"}[End of file No.120]

You can find your API key at https://beta.openai.com\n```\n\n\nHere are a few simple steps you can take to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Clear your browser's cache\n\n\nThe first step is to clear your browser's cache. Sometimes, your browser may hold onto an outdated version of your API key, which can cause this error message to appear. To clear your browser's cache, follow the instructions for your specific browser:\n\n\n* For Google Chrome, click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"History.\" Then, click on \"Clear browsing data\" and select \"Cookies and other site data\" and \"Cached images and files.\"\n* For Firefox, click on the three lines in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"Options.\" Then, click on \"Privacy & Security\" and scroll down to \"Cookies and Site Data.\" Click on \"Clear Data\" and select \"Cookies and Site Data\" and \"Cached Web Content.\"\n* For Safari, click on \"Safari\" in the top menu bar and select \"Preferences.\" Then, click on the \"Privacy\" tab and click on \"Manage Website Data.\" Select \"Remove All\" to clear your browser's cache.\n\nStep 2: Retry your request\n\n\nAfter clearing your browser's cache, try your request again. If the error message still appears, then move to the next step.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Check your API key\n\n\nCheck your API key at **[https://beta.openai.com](https://beta.openai.com/)** and verify it with the API key shown in the error message. Sometimes, the error message may include an old or incorrect API key that you no longer use. Double-check that you are using the correct API key for the request you're making.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Verify that you're not using two different API keys\n\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have accidentally used two different API keys. Make sure that you are using the same API key throughout your application or script and not switching between different keys.\n\n\n\nIf you still need help please reach out to our support team, and they will assist you with resolving the issue.\n\n\n  \n\u200b\n\n\n\n", "title": "Incorrect API key provided", "article_id": "6882433", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6882433-incorrect-api-key-provided"}[End of file No.124]

# Support bot

This example is a customer service bot which includes a user interface agent and a help center agent with several tools.
This example uses the helper function `run_demo_loop`, which allows us to create an interactive Swarm session.

## Overview

The support bot consists of two main agents:

1. **User Interface Agent**: Handles initial user interactions and directs them to the help center agent based on their needs.
2. **Help Center Agent**: Provides detailed help and support using various tools and integrated with a Qdrant VectorDB for documentation retrieval.

## Setup

To start the support bot:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Install the necessary additional libraries:

```shell
make install
```

3. Initialize docker

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Prepare the vector DB:

```shell
make prep
```

5. Run the main scripy:

```shell
make run
```

New accounts created after June 3rd will not have access to this endpoint.\n\n\n\nWe strongly encourage developers to switch over to newer techniques which produce better results, outlined below.\n\n\n\nCurrent documentation\n---------------------\n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/answers> \n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/answers>\n\n\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n\nAs a quick review, here are the high level steps of the current Answers endpoint:\n\n\n\n\n![](https://openai.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/524217540/51eda23e171f33f1b9d5acff/rM6ZVI3XZ2CpxcEStmG5mFy6ATBCskmX2g3_GPmeY3FicvrWfJCuFOtzsnbkpMQe-TQ6hi5j1BV9cFo7bCDcsz8VWxFfeOnC1Gb4QNaeVYtJq4Qtg76SBOLLk-jgHUA8mWZ0QgOuV636UgcvMA)All of these options are also outlined [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints)\n\n\n\nOption 1: Transition to Embeddings-based search (recommended)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe believe that most use cases will be better served by moving the underlying search system to use a vector-based embedding search. The major reason for this is that our current system used a bigram filter to narrow down the scope of candidates whereas our embeddings system has much more contextual awareness. Also, in general, using embeddings will be considerably lower cost in the long run. If you\u2019re not familiar with this, you can learn more by visiting our [guide to embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using a small dataset (<10,000 documents), consider using the techniques described in that guide to find the best documents to construct a prompt similar to [this](#h_89196129b2). Then, you can just submit that prompt to our [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) endpoint.\n\n\n\nIf you have a larger dataset, consider using a vector search engine like [Pinecone](https://share.streamlit.io/pinecone-io/playground/beyond_search_openai/src/server.py) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai.html) to power that search.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Reimplement existing functionality\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to recreate the functionality of the Answers endpoint, here\u2019s how we did it. There is also a [script](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints/answers_functionality_example.py) that replicates most of this functionality.\n\n\n\nAt a high level, there are two main ways you can use the answers endpoint: you can source the data from an uploaded file or send it in with the request.\n\n\n\n**If you\u2019re using the document parameter**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one step if you provide the documents in the Answers API call.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used: \n\n\n* Construct the prompt [with this format.](#h_89196129b2)\n* Gather all of the provided documents. If they fit in the prompt, just use all of them.\n* Do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) (note that this is also being deprecated and has a [transition guide](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/dgkjq2bp/articles/articles/6272952/show)) where the documents are the user provided documents and the query is the query from above. Rank the documents by score.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the context.\n* Request a completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc)\n\n\nThroughout all of this, you\u2019ll need to check that the prompt\u2019s length doesn\u2019t exceed [the model's token limit](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/gpt-3). To assess the number of tokens present in a prompt, we recommend <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast>. \n\n\n\nIf you're using the file parameter\n----------------------------------\n\n\nStep 1: upload a jsonl file\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, we upload new files meant for answers to an Elastic search cluster. Each line of the jsonl is then submitted as a document.\n\n\n\nIf you uploaded the file with the purpose \u201canswers,\u201d we additionally split the documents on newlines and upload each of those chunks as separate documents to ensure that we can search across and reference the highest number of relevant text sections in the file.\n\n\n\nEach line requires a \u201ctext\u201d field and an optional \u201cmetadata\u201d field.\n\n\n\nThese are the Elastic search settings and mappings for our index:\n\n\n\n[Elastic searching mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html): \n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"properties\": {  \n        \"document\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"}, -> the \u201ctext\u201d field  \n        \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"enabled\": False}, -> the \u201cmetadata\u201d field  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\n[Elastic search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html):\n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"analysis\": {  \n        \"analyzer\": {  \n            \"standard_bigram_analyzer\": {  \n                \"type\": \"custom\",  \n                \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",  \n                \"filter\": [\"lowercase\", \"english_stop\", \"shingle\"],  \n            }  \n        },  \n        \"filter\": {\"english_stop\": {\"type\": \"stop\", \"stopwords\": \"_english_\"}},  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\nAfter that, we performed [standard Elastic search search calls](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.2.0/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search) and used `max\\_rerank` to determine the number of documents to return from Elastic search.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Search\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used. Our end goal is to create a [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) request [with this format](#h_89196129b2). It will look very similar to [Documents](#h_cb1d8a8d3f)\n\n\n\nFrom there, our steps are: \n\n\n* Start with the `experimental\\_alternative\\_question` or, if that's not provided, what\u2019s in the `question` field. Call that the query.\n* Query Elastic search for `max\\_rerank` documents with query as the search param.\n* Take those documents and do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) on them where the entries from Elastic search are the docs, and the query is the query that you used above. Use the score from the search to rank the documents.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the prompt.\n* Request an OpenAI completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc). Return that answer to the user.\n\n\nCompletion Prompt\n-----------------\n\n\n\n```\n===  \nContext: #{{ provided examples_context }}  \n===  \nQ: example 1 question  \nA: example 1 answer  \n---  \nQ: example 2 question  \nA: example 2 answer  \n(and so on for all examples provided in the request)   \n===  \nContext: #{{ what we return from Elasticsearch }}  \n===  \nQ: #{{ user provided question }}   \nA:\n```\n", "title": "Answers Transition Guide", "article_id": "6233728", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6233728-answers-transition-guide"}[End of file No.166]

Each line of the jsonl is then submitted as a document.\n\n\n\nIn each line we require a \u201ctext\u201d field, a \u201clabel\u201d field, and an optional \u201cmetadata\u201d field\n\n\n\nThese are the Elastic search settings and mappings for our index:\n\n\n\n[Elastic searching mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html): \n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"properties\": {  \n        \"document\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"}, -> the \u201ctext\u201d field  \n        \"label\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"},  \n        \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"enabled\": False}, -> the \u201cmetadata\u201d field  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\n[Elastic search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html):\n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"analysis\": {  \n        \"analyzer\": {  \n            \"standard_bigram_analyzer\": {  \n                \"type\": \"custom\",  \n                \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",  \n                \"filter\": [\"lowercase\", \"english_stop\", \"shingle\"],  \n            }  \n        },  \n        \"filter\": {\"english_stop\": {\"type\": \"stop\", \"stopwords\": \"_english_\"}},  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\nAfter that, we performed [standard Elastic search search calls](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.2.0/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search) and used `max\\_examples` to determine the number of documents to return from Elastic search.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Search\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used. Our end goal is to create a [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) request [with this format](#h_e63b71a5c8). It will look very similar to [Documents](#h_51fe4aed6d).\n\n\n\nFrom there, our steps are: \n\n\n* Start with the `experimental\\_alternative\\_question` or, if that's not provided, what\u2019s in the `question` field. Call that the query.\n* Query Elastic search for `max\\_examples` documents with query as the search param.\n* Take those documents and do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) on them where the entries from Elastic search are the docs, and the query is the query that you used above. Use the score from the search to rank the documents.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the prompt. Try to maximize the number of distinct labels as that will help the model understand the different labels that are available.\n* Request an OpenAI completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc). Return that generation to the user.\n\n\nCompletion Prompt\n-----------------\n\n\n\n```\n#{{ an optional instruction }}  \n  \nText: #{{example 1 text}}  \nCategory: #{{example 1 label}}  \n---  \nText: #{{example 2 text}}  \nCategory: #{{example 2 label}}  \n---  \nText: #{{question}}  \nCategory:\n```\n\n", "title": "Classifications Transition Guide", "article_id": "6272941", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6272941-classifications-transition-guide"}[End of file No.167]

{"text": "Introduction\n============\n\n\n\u200bSince releasing the Search endpoint, we\u2019ve developed new methods that achieve better results for this task. As a result, we\u2019ll be removing the Search endpoint from our documentation and removing access to this endpoint for all organizations on December 3, 2022. New accounts created after June 3rd will not have access to this endpoint.\n\n\n\nWe strongly encourage developers to switch over to newer techniques which produce better results, outlined below.\n\n\n\nCurrent documentation\n---------------------\n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/search> \n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches> \n\n\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n\nThis options are also outlined [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints).\n\n\n\nOption 1: Transition to Embeddings-based search (recommended)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe believe that most use cases will be better served by moving the underlying search system to use a vector-based embedding search. The major reason for this is that our current system used a bigram filter to narrow down the scope of candidates whereas our embeddings system has much more contextual awareness. Also, in general, using embeddings will be considerably lower cost in the long run. If you\u2019re not familiar with this, you can learn more by visiting our [guide to embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).\n\n\n\nIf you have a larger dataset (>10,000 documents), consider using a vector search engine like [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai.html) to power that search.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Reimplement existing functionality\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using the document parameter\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nThe current openai.Search.create and openai.Engine.search code can be replaced with this [snippet](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints/search_functionality_example.py) (note this will only work with non-Codex engines since they use a different tokenizer.)\n\n\n\nWe plan to move this snippet into the openai-python repo under openai.Search.create\\_legacy.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using the file parameter\n----------------------------------\n\n\nAs a quick review, here are the high level steps of the current Search endpoint with a file:\n\n\n\n\n![](https://openai.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/524222854/57382ab799ebe9bb988c0a1f/_y63ycSmtiFAS3slJdbfW0Mz-0nx2DP4gNAjyknMAmTT1fQUE9d7nha5yfsXJLkWRFmM41uvjPxi2ToSW4vrF7EcasiQDG51CrKPNOpXPVG4WZXI8jC8orWSmuGhAGGC4KoUYucwJOh0bH9Nzw)\n\n\nStep 1: upload a jsonl file\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, we upload new files meant for file search to an Elastic search. Each line of the jsonl is then submitted as a document.\n\n\n\nEach line is required to have a \u201ctext\u201d field and an optional \u201cmetadata\u201d field.\n\n\n\nThese are the Elastic search settings and mappings for our index:\n\n\n\n[Elastic searching mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html): \n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"properties\": {  \n        \"document\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"}, -> the \u201ctext\u201d field  \n        \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"enabled\": False}, -> the \u201cmetadata\u201d field  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\n[Elastic search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html):\n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"analysis\": {  \n        \"analyzer\": {  \n            \"standard_bigram_analyzer\": {  \n                \"type\": \"custom\",  \n                \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",  \n                \"filter\": [\"lowercase\", \"english_stop\", \"shingle\"],  \n            }  \n        },  \n        \"filter\": {\"english_stop\": {\"type\": \"stop\", \"stopwords\": \"_english_\"}},  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\nAfter that, we performed [standard Elastic search search calls](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.2.0/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search) and used `max\\_rerank` to determine the number of documents to return from Elastic search.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Search\n\n\nOnce you have the candidate documents from step 1, you could just make a standard openai.Search.create or openai.Engine.search call to rerank the candidates.

{"text": "*This article is only relevant if you started using the API before June 6, 2022.*\n\n\n\nWe are deprecating the term \u2018engine\u2019 in favor of \u2018model\u2019. Most people already use these terms interchangeably, and we consistently hear that \u2018model\u2019 is more intuitive. \n\n\n\nMoving forward, API requests will work by referencing a \u2018model\u2019 instead of an \u2018engine\u2019. If you have used a fine-tuned model, then you are already familiar with using \u2018model\u2019 instead of \u2018engine\u2019 when making an API request. Engine listing is also being replaced by Model listing, which will consolidate both base and fine-tuned models in a single place.\n\n\n\n**We will maintain backward compatibility for requests using \u2018engine\u2019 as a parameter, but recommend updating your implementation as soon as you can to prevent future confusion.**\n\n\n\nFor example, a request to the completions endpoint would now be (full details in our [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference)):\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Deprecated** | **Current** |\n| \n```\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(  engine=\"text-davinci-002\",  prompt=\u201dSay hello world three times.\u201d,  temperature=0.6)\n```\n | \n```\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(  model=\"text-davinci-002\",  prompt=\u201dSay hello world three times.\u201d,  temperature=0.6)\n```\n |\n| \n```\nopenai api completions.create -e text-davinci-002 -p \"Say hello world three times.\"\n```\n\n | \n```\nopenai api completions.create -m text-davinci-002 -p \"Say hello world three times.\"\n```\n\n |\n| \n```\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-davinci-002/completions \\-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\-H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\-d '{\"prompt\": \"Say hello world three times\", \"temperature\": 0.6}'\n```\n | \n```\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/completions \\-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\-H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\-d '{\"prompt\": \"Say hello world three times\",\"model\":\"text-davinci-002\", \"temperature\": 0.6}'\n```\n |\n\nWe have updated endpoint URL paths accordingly (full details in our [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference)):\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Deprecated** | **Current** |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{engine_id}/completions\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/completions\n```\n |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{engine_id}/embeddings\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\n```\n |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/models\n```\n |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{engine_id}/edits\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/edits\n```\n |\n\n\n\n", "title": "What happened to \u2018engines\u2019?", "article_id": "6283125", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6283125-what-happened-to-engines"}

There are a couple caveats of which to be mindful:\n\n\n* Email addresses: **You'll need to use a new email address**.\n\n\n\t+ Since every email address is unique per account, we require a different email address for new accounts. If you don't have an alternative email address, you can try using what's known as an email subaddress: instead of [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com), try [jane+alt@example.com](mailto:jane+alt@example.com). Emails to this address should still go to the same inbox (everything after the + is typically ignored by your email provider), but we'll treat this as a unique email address.\n* Phone numbers: New accounts are still subject to our limit of [3 accounts per phone number](https://help.openai.com/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq#h_de13bb96c0). Deleted accounts also count toward this limit. Deleting an account does not free up another spot.

Make sure to download often to avoid losing work due to browser freezes!\n\nThe FAQ below will help you learn how to get the most out of these new tools:\n\n\n\nHow do I access the DALL\u00b7E editor?\n==================================\n\n\nOnce you're logged in on a desktop device, you can launch the editor in two ways:\n\n\n* **Start with an image**: From any image on the DALL-E website, you can click the \"Edit\" button to drop into an editor with that image as the starting point.\n* **Start with a blank canvas:** If you'd prefer to start from scratch, you can bookmark and use the following URL: https://labs.openai.com/editor\n\nWhile users on mobile devices don't have access to advanced editor features like outpainting, you can still inpaint images by tapping \"Edit\" on an existing image you've generated or uploaded.\n\n\n\nHow much does usage of the DALL\u00b7E editor cost?\n==============================================\n\n\nLike DALL\u00b7E's other functionality, each prompt you submit by clicking the \"Generate\" button will deduct one credit from your credit balance (regardless of how many pixels you are filling in).\n\n\n\nYou can always purchase additional credits from the user dropdown at the top right of the application.\n\n\n\nHow do I use the editor most effectively?\n=========================================\n\n\nThe **Generation frame** contains the image context that the model will see when you submit a text prompt, so make sure that it contains enough useful context for the area you are expanding into, otherwise the style may drift from the rest of your image.\n\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/571876595/9e431c455e24421079bee9d3/Screen+Shot+2022-08-30+at+2.55.38+PM.png)You can simultaneously **Erase** parts of your image to touch up or replace certain areas, and perfect the finer details.\n\n\n\nYou can also **Upload** existing images, optionally resize them, and then place them within the canvas to bring additional imagery into the scene. This is a powerful feature that enables you to fuse images together, connect opposite ends of an image for loops, and \"uncrop\" images that you can combine with other tooling to create recursively expanding animations.\n\n\n\nThe **Download** tool will export the latest state of the artwork as .png file. We recommend downloading often to keep snapshots of your work. You can always re-upload previous snapshots to continue where you left off.\n\n\n\nWhat keyboard shortcuts are supported?\n======================================\n\n\nThe editor supports keyboard shortcuts for zooming, switching tools, undo/redo, and more. Press **?** while using the editor to show the full list of keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\n\nAre there any other tips & tricks to be aware of?\n=================================================\n\n\n* Start with the character before the landscape, if there are characters involved, so you can get the body morphology right before filling the rest.\n* Make sure you're keeping enough of the existing image in the generation frame to avoid the style drifting too much.\n* Ask DALL\u00b7E for a muted color palette, especially as you stray further from the center, to avoid oversaturation and color-blasting.\n* Consider what story you\u2019re trying to tell when picking the direction you want to expand the image into.\n\n\n\n", "title": "DALL\u00b7E Editor Guide", "article_id": "6516417", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6516417-dall-e-editor-guide"}[End of file No.182]

{"text": "\n**ChatGPT**\n\n\nPhone verification is no longer required for new OpenAI account creation or ChatGPT usage.\n\n\n\n**API**\n\n\nPhone verification is now mandated on platform.openai.com for generating your initial API key, though not for any subsequent API key generation after that.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need to provide my phone number to generate my **first** API key on **platform**.openai.com?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhen you generate your first API key on platform.openai.com, we do require a phone number for security reasons. This allows us to verify your account and ensure our platform remains secure. \n\n\n\nYou only need to complete phone verification generating the 1st API key not any subsequent API keys after that.\n\n\n\nWe don't use your phone number for any other purposes, and take your privacy very seriously.\n\n\n\nCan I use a premium number, landline, Google Voice, or other VoIP phone number?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do **`not`** support use of `landlines`, `VoIP`, `Google Voice`, or `premium numbers` at this time. All of those types of phone numbers are often associated with higher instances of fraud or abuse.\n\n\n\nFor this reason we only support completing phone verification via mobile phone numbers over an SMS text message, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHave you always blocked VoIP numbers?\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nYes, we have always blocked VoIP services in the United States to ensure the safety and security of our users. Recently, we have expanded our blocking policy to include VoIP services internationally. This means that VoIP services are now blocked in countries outside the United States as well.\n\n\n\nI don't want to receive the SMS can I phone verify over email/call instead?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. The phone verification can only be completed with a text message via SMS (or WhatsApp, if available in your country). The code cannot be sent via email or done over phone call.\n\n\n\nWhy am I not receiving my phone verification code SMS?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you're not receiving your phone verification code, it's possible that our system has temporarily blocked you due to too many verification attempts or an issue occurred during your first request.\n\n\n\nPlease try again in a few hours and make sure you're within cellphone coverage, and you're not using any text-blocker applications.\n\n\n\nWhat does this error mean? \"Detected suspicious behavior from phone numbers similar to yours\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis means our system has detected unusual activity or patterns from phone numbers that are similar to the one you're using for verification. This error is triggered as a security measure to prevent potential fraud or abuse of the platform.\n\n\n\nRemember that security measures like this are in place to protect your account and maintain the integrity of the platform. Ensure that your personal information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nHow many times can I use the same phone number to complete the phone verification associated with an OpenAI account's first API key generation?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nHow do free trial tokens work?\n------------------------------\n\n\nFree trial tokens to API users on platform.openai.com are only given for the first time you sign up then complete phone verification during the first API key generation. No accounts created after that get free trial tokens, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHow do I resolve I get an error that I can't sign up due to \"unsupported country\"?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis may be that you're trying to complete phone verification on the initial API key generation on platform.openai.com using a phone number from a country or territory we do not support.\n\n\n\nSee [Supported countries and territories](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries).\n\n\n\nWhich countries do you support for WhatsApp phone verification?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn certain countries you can complete phone verification with WhatsApp instead of via an SMS.\n\n\n\nAs of Wednesday, September 27th, 2023 the countries we support for that include:\n\n\n* \u201cIN\u201d, # India\n* \u201cID\u201d, # Indonesia\n* \u201cPK\u201d, # Pakistan\n* \u201cNG\u201d, # Nigeria\n* \u201cIL\u201d, # Israel\n* \u201cSA\u201d, # Saudi Arabia\n* \u201cAE\u201d, # United Arab Emirates\n* \u201cUA\u201d, # Ukraine\n* \u201cMY\u201d, # Malaysia\n* \u201cTR\u201d, # Turkey\n\n### What will phone verification look like?\n\n\nOur default drop-down is set to the United States which looks like this:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658048438/d0ae000cb03c874071cc470a/phone+verification+step+1.png)Then if you select one of the countries in our list above which include the WhatsApp alternative phone verification option - using India as an example - you'll see this UI:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049199/9d36ef51ff688434496e9a60/phone+verification+step+2.png)Then to get your code sent to WhatsApp you can select \"YES\" and that option appears:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049679/e35901be2b3899487a0d7c46/phone+verification+step+3.png)", "title": "Phone verification FAQ", "article_id": "6613520", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq"}[End of file No.187]

The higher the `temperature`, the more random (and usually creative) the output. This, however, is not the same as \u201ctruthfulness\u201d. For most factual use cases such as data extraction, and truthful Q&A, the `temperature` of 0 is best.\n3. **`max_tokens`** (**maximum length)** - Does not control the length of the output, but a hard cutoff limit for token generation. Ideally you won\u2019t hit this limit often, as your model will stop either when it thinks it\u2019s finished, or when it hits a stop sequence you defined.\n4. **`stop` (stop sequences)** - A set of characters (tokens) that, when generated, will cause the text generation to stop.\n\nFor other parameter descriptions see the [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create).\n\n\n\n\n**Additional Resources**\n========================\n\n\nIf you're interested in additional resources, we recommend:\n\n\n* Guides\n\n\n\t+ [Text completion](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/text-completion) - learn how to generate or edit text using our models\n\t+ [Code completion](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/code/code-completion-private-beta) - explore prompt engineering for Codex\n\t+ [Fine-tuning](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/fine-tuning) - Learn how to train a custom model for your use case\n\t+ [Embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embeddings) - learn how to search, classify, and compare text\n\t+ [Moderation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/moderation)\n* [OpenAI cookbook repo](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples) - contains example code and prompts for accomplishing common tasks with the API, including Question-answering with Embeddings\n* [Community Forum](https://community.openai.com/)\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "Best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI API", "article_id": "6654000", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api"}[End of file No.205]

Unfortunately, you won\u2019t always get the same result from the [Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground).\n\n\n\n**Our language models currently struggle with math**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems. In other words if you were to try this example in our Playground using text-davinci-002 you will likely get inconsistent answers when performing math. With some generations you will get the correct answer, however we do not recommend you depend on the GPT models for math tasks.\n\n\n\n**What you can do to improve output consistency in our Playground**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Disclaimer**: Even implementing everything below there is only so far we can push the current model.\n\n\n1. The GPT models are great at recognizing patterns, but without enough data they\u2019ll try their best to interpret and recreate a pattern that seems most probable. With minimal data it\u2019s likely to produce a wide variety of potential outputs.\n2. A prompt designed like a homework assignment, will generally have clear instructions on the task and expected output, and may include an example task to further establish the expectations around the task and output format. The text-davinci-002 model does best with an instruction, so the request should be presented in a format that starts with an instruction. Without this the model may not understand your expectations and it will be a bit confused.\n\n**Using the \"solve for x where 3x + 4 = 66\" example:**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo improve this [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/undsPkd4LAdmFC4SILzvnJ6e) we can add the following:\n\n\n1. Start with an instruction like, \u201cGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable\u201d, then test to see the results.\n2. Append to the instruction a description of the expected output, \u201cProvide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>\u2019\u201c, then test once more\n3. If results are still inconsistent, append an example problem to the instructions. This example will help establish the pattern that you want the model to recognize and follow, \u201cProblem: 3x+4=66, solve for x. <newline> Answer: x=\u201d\n4. The final result will be a [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/I4yzqABsUqjQASw6CwM1OftR) that looks like this:\n\n\n```\nGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable. Provide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>.   \nProblem1: y-1=0, solve for y  \nAnswer1: y=1  \n---  \nProblem2: 3x+4=66, solve for x.  \nAnswer2: x=\n```\n\n\n**Overall recommendation for math problems**\n\n\nWe are aware our currently available models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems.

  "text": "Fine-tuning with GPT-3.5\n========================\n\n\nFine-tuning data provides models with examples of how it should respond do a given conversation. We'll want these examples to match the input that the model will see in production as closely as possible. \n\n\n\n#### First, system instructions.\n\n\nThese tell the model how to act, and supply any contextual information. You should use the prompt used in the training dataset when calling the fine-tuned model.\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"}\n```\n\n#### \n**Second,** conversation **data.**\n\n\nWe'll want to provide varied examples of conversations that the model may run into, such as \"What's the capital of France?\" and \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}\n```\n\n#### Next, the agent response.\n\n\nHere, we present the model with an example of how to respond to the previous message, given the system instruction. For our snarky agent, we may choose a response like this:\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"agent\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}\n```\n\n\n#### Finally, putting it all together.\n\n\nOnce we have many examples, we can put these all together and begin training. Our dataset should look like follows:\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},    \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}  \n{\"role\": \"agent\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}]}  \n  \n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},   \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"},   \n{\"role\": \"agent\", \"content\": \"Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?\"}]}  \n  \n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},   \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How far is the Moon from Earth?\"},   \n{\"role\": \"agent\", \"content\": \"Around 384,400 kilometers. Give or take a few, like that really matters.\"}]}\n```\n\n\n\nFine-tuning with babbage and davinci\n====================================\n\n\nTo fine-tune effectively without ChatCompletions, you need to format your data properly to provide clues to the model about where to start and stop generating text. \n\n\n\n**Indicator String** \n\n\nThe indicator string is a symbol or sequence of symbols that you append to the end of your prompt to tell the model that you want it to start generating text after this string. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to categorize items as colors, you can use an indicator string like '->'. The prompts in your dataset would look like this:\n\n\n* 'banana ->'\n* 'lime ->'\n* 'tomato ->'\n\nYou can use any string as an indicator string as long as it doesn't appear anywhere else in the dataset. We recommend using '\\n###\\n'.\n\n\n\n**Stop Sequence**\n\n\nThe stop sequence is another special symbol or sequence of symbols that you use to tell the model that you want it to stop generating text after that point. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to generate one word as a completion, you can use a stop sequence such as \"\\n\" (newline) or \".\" (period) to mark the end of the completion, like this: \n\n\n* 'prompt' : 'banana ->', 'completion' : ' yellow \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'lime ->', 'completion' : ' green \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'tomato ->', 'completion' : ' red \\n'\n\n\n**Calling the model**\n\n\nYou should use the same symbols used in your dataset when calling the model. If you used the dataset above, you should use '\\n' as a stop sequence. You should also append '->' to your prompts as an indicator string (e.g. prompt: 'lemon -> ')\n\n\n\nIt is important that you use consistent and unique symbols for the indicator string and the stop sequence, and that they don't appear anywhere else in your data. Otherwise, the model might get confused and generate unwanted or incorrect text. \n\n\n\n**Extra Recommendations**\n\n\nWe also recommend appending a single space character at the beginning of your outputs. \n\n\n\nYou can also use our [command line tool](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/cli-data-preparation-tool) to help format your dataset, after you have prepared it.\n\n",

{"text": "How can I tell how many tokens a string will have before I try to embed it?\n===========================================================================\n\n\nFor V2 embedding models, as of Dec 2022, there is not yet a way to split a string into tokens. The only way to get total token counts is to submit an API request.\n\n\n* If the request succeeds, you can extract the number of tokens from the response: `response[\u201cusage\u201d][\u201ctotal\\_tokens\u201d]`\n* If the request fails for having too many tokens, you can extract the number of tokens from the error message: `This model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, however you requested 10000 tokens (10000 in your prompt; 0 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.`\n\n\nFor V1 embedding models, which are based on GPT-2/GPT-3 tokenization, you can count tokens in a few ways:\n\n\n* For one-off checks, the [OpenAI tokenizer](https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer) page is convenient\n* In Python, [transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast) (the GPT-2 tokenizer is the same as GPT-3)\n* In JavaScript, [gpt-3-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-3-encoder)\n\n\nHow can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?\n=======================================================\n\n\nFor searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database.\n\n\n\nVector database options include:\n\n\n* [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), a fully managed vector database\n* [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), an open-source vector search engine\n* [Faiss](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/), a vector search algorithm by Facebook\n\nWhich distance function should I use?\n=====================================\n\n\nWe recommend [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). The choice of distance function typically doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\n\n\nOpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:\n\n\n* Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product\n* Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in the identical rankings\n", "title": "Embeddings - Frequently Asked Questions", "article_id": "6824809", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6824809-embeddings-frequently-asked-questions"}[End of file No.217]

Each continuation counts towards the message allowance.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (May 3, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n* You can now turn off chat history and export your data from the ChatGPT settings. Conversations that are started when chat history is disabled won\u2019t be used to train and improve our models, and won\u2019t appear in the history sidebar.\n* We are deprecating the Legacy (GPT-3.5) model on May 10th. Users will be able to continue their existing conversations with this model, but new messages will use the default model.\n\nIntroducing plugins in ChatGPT (March 23, 2023)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe are announcing experimental support for AI plugins in ChatGPT \u2014 tools designed specifically for language models. Plugins can help ChatGPT access up-to-date information, run computations, or use third-party services. You can learn more about plugins [here](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins).\n\n\n\nToday, we will begin extending plugin access to users and developers from our waitlist.

Here's what's new:\n\n\n* We\u2019ve updated performance of the ChatGPT model on our free plan in order to serve more users.\n* Based on user feedback, we are now defaulting Plus users to a faster version of ChatGPT, formerly known as \u201cTurbo\u201d. We\u2019ll keep the previous version around for a while.\n* We rolled out the ability to purchase [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/) internationally.\n\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Plus (Feb 9 2023)\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nAs we recently announced, our Plus plan comes with early access to new, experimental features. We are beginning to roll out a way for Plus users the ability to choose between different versions of ChatGPT: \n\n\n* Default: the standard ChatGPT model\n* Turbo: optimized for speed (alpha)\n\nVersion selection is made easy with a dedicated dropdown menu at the top of the page. Depending on feedback, we may roll out this feature (or just Turbo) to all users soon.\n\n\n\nFactuality and mathematical improvements (Jan 30, 2023)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve upgraded the ChatGPT model with improved factuality and mathematical capabilities.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (Jan 9, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. We made more improvements to the ChatGPT model! It should be generally better across a wide range of topics and has improved factuality.\n2. Stop generating: Based on your feedback, we've added the ability to stop generating ChatGPT's response\n\n\nPerformance updates to ChatGPT (Dec 15, 2022)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. General performance: Among other improvements, users will notice that ChatGPT is now less likely to refuse to answer questions.\n2. Conversation history: You\u2019ll soon be able to view past conversations with ChatGPT, rename your saved conversations and delete the ones you don\u2019t want to keep. We are gradually rolling out this feature.\n3. Daily limit: To ensure a high-quality experience for all ChatGPT users, we are experimenting with a daily message cap. If you\u2019re included in this group, you\u2019ll be presented with an option to extend your access by providing feedback to ChatGPT.\n\nTo see if you\u2019re using the updated version, look for \u201cChatGPT Dec 15 Version\u201d at the bottom of the screen.\n\n",

{"text": "When you get the error message:\n\n\n\n\n```\nIncorrect API key provided: API_KEY*********************************ZXY. You can find your API key at https://beta.openai.com\n```\n\n\nHere are a few simple steps you can take to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Clear your browser's cache\n\n\nThe first step is to clear your browser's cache. Sometimes, your browser may hold onto an outdated version of your API key, which can cause this error message to appear. To clear your browser's cache, follow the instructions for your specific browser:\n\n\n* For Google Chrome, click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"History.\" Then, click on \"Clear browsing data\" and select \"Cookies and other site data\" and \"Cached images and files.\"\n* For Firefox, click on the three lines in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"Options.\" Then, click on \"Privacy & Security\" and scroll down to \"Cookies and Site Data.\" Click on \"Clear Data\" and select \"Cookies and Site Data\" and \"Cached Web Content.\"\n* For Safari, click on \"Safari\" in the top menu bar and select \"Preferences.\" Then, click on the \"Privacy\" tab and click on \"Manage Website Data.\" Select \"Remove All\" to clear your browser's cache.\n\nStep 2: Retry your request\n\n\nAfter clearing your browser's cache, try your request again. If the error message still appears, then move to the next step.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Check your API key\n\n\nCheck your API key at **[https://beta.openai.com](https://beta.openai.com/)** and verify it with the API key shown in the error message. Sometimes, the error message may include an old or incorrect API key that you no longer use. Double-check that you are using the correct API key for the request you're making.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Verify that you're not using two different API keys\n\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have accidentally used two different API keys. Make sure that you are using the same API key throughout your application or script and not switching between different keys.\n\n\n\nIf you still need help please reach out to our support team, and they will assist you with resolving the issue.\n\n\n  \n\u200b\n\n\n\n", "title": "Incorrect API key provided", "article_id": "6882433", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6882433-incorrect-api-key-provided"}[End of file No.222]

{"text": "Every organization is bound by rate limits which determine how many requests can be sent per second. This rate limit has been hit by the request.\n\n\n\nRate limits can be quantized, meaning they are enforced over shorter periods of time (e.g. 60,000 requests/minute may be enforced as 1,000 requests/second). Sending short bursts of requests or contexts (prompts+max\\_tokens) that are too long can lead to rate limit errors, even when you are technically below the rate limit per minute.\n\n\n\n**How can I fix it?**\n\n\n* Include [exponential back-off](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_handle_rate_limits.ipynb) logic in your code. This will catch and retry failed requests.\n* For token limits\n\n\n\t+ Reduce the [max\\_tokens](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-max_tokens) to match the size of your completions. Usage needs are estimated from this value, so reducing it will decrease the chance that you unexpectedly receive a rate limit error. For example, if your prompt creates completions around 400 tokens, the max\\_tokens value should be around the same size.\n\t+ [Optimize your prompts](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main#more-prompt-advice). You can do this by making your instructions shorter, removing extra words, and getting rid of extra examples. You might need to work on your prompt and test it after these changes to make sure it still works well. The added benefit of a shorter prompt is reduced cost to you. If you need help, let us know.\n* If none of the previous steps work and you are consistently hitting a Rate Limit Error, you can increase your rate limits by [increasing your usage tier](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers).

# Personal shopper

This Swarm is a personal shopping agent that can help with making sales and refunding orders.
This example uses the helper function `run_demo_loop`, which allows us to create an interactive Swarm session.
In this example, we also use a Sqlite3 database with customer information and transaction data.

## Overview

The personal shopper example includes three main agents to handle various customer service requests:

1. **Triage Agent**: Determines the type of request and transfers to the appropriate agent.
2. **Refund Agent**: Manages customer refunds, requiring both user ID and item ID to initiate a refund.
3. **Sales Agent**: Handles actions related to placing orders, requiring both user ID and product ID to complete a purchase.

## Setup

Once you have installed dependencies and Swarm, run the example using:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

# Swarm basic

This folder contains basic examples demonstrating core Swarm capabilities. These examples show the simplest implementations of Swarm, with one input message, and a corresponding output. The `simple_loop_no_helpers` has a while loop to demonstrate how to create an interactive Swarm session.

### Examples

1. **agent_handoff.py**

   - Demonstrates how to transfer a conversation from one agent to another.
   - **Usage**: Transfers Spanish-speaking users from an English agent to a Spanish agent.

2. **bare_minimum.py**

   - A bare minimum example showing the basic setup of an agent.
   - **Usage**: Sets up an agent that responds to a simple user message.

3. **context_variables.py**

   - Shows how to use context variables within an agent.
   - **Usage**: Uses context variables to greet a user by name and print account details.

4. **function_calling.py**

   - Demonstrates how to define and call functions from an agent.
   - **Usage**: Sets up an agent that can respond with weather information for a given location.

5. **simple_loop_no_helpers.py**
   - An example of a simple interaction loop without using helper functions.
   - **Usage**: Sets up a loop where the user can continuously interact with the agent, printing the conversation.

## Running the Examples

To run any of the examples, use the following command:

```shell
python3 <example_name>.py
```

# Triage agent

This example is a Swarm containing a triage agent, which takes in user inputs and chooses whether to respond directly, or triage the request
to a sales or refunds agent.

## Setup

To run the triage agent Swarm:

1. Run

```shell
python3 run.py
```

## Evals

> [!NOTE]
> These evals are intended to be examples to demonstrate functionality, but will have to be updated and catered to your particular use case.

This example uses `Pytest` to run eval unit tests. We have two tests in the `evals.py` file, one which
tests if we call the correct triage function when expected, and one which assesses if a conversation
is 'successful', as defined in our prompt in `evals.py`.

To run the evals, run

```shell
pytest evals.py
```

# Weather agent

This example is a weather agent demonstrating function calling with a single agent. The agent has tools to get the weather of a particular city, and send an email.

## Setup

To run the weather agent Swarm:

1. Run

```shell
python3 run.py
```

## Evals

> [!NOTE]
> These evals are intended to be examples to demonstrate functionality, but will have to be updated and catered to your particular use case.

This example uses `Pytest` to run eval unit tests. We have two tests in the `evals.py` file, one which
tests if we call the `get_weather` function when expected, and one which assesses if we properly do NOT call the
`get_weather` function when we shouldn't have a tool call.

To run the evals, run

```shell
pytest evals.py
```

# Airline customer service

This example demonstrates a multi-agent setup for handling different customer service requests in an airline context using the Swarm framework. The agents can triage requests, handle flight modifications, cancellations, and lost baggage cases.
This example uses the helper function `run_demo_loop`, which allows us to create an interactive Swarm session.

## Agents

1. **Triage Agent**: Determines the type of request and transfers to the appropriate agent.
2. **Flight Modification Agent**: Handles requests related to flight modifications, further triaging them into:
   - **Flight Cancel Agent**: Manages flight cancellation requests.
   - **Flight Change Agent**: Manages flight change requests.
3. **Lost Baggage Agent**: Handles lost baggage inquiries.

## Setup

Once you have installed dependencies and Swarm, run the example using:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

## Evaluations

> [!NOTE]
> These evals are intended to be examples to demonstrate functionality, but will have to be updated and catered to your particular use case.

For this example, we run function evals, where we input a conversation, and the expected function call ('None' if no function call is expected).
The evaluation cases are stored in `eval/eval_cases/` subfolder.

```json
[
  {
    "conversation": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "My bag was not delivered!" }
    ],
    "function": "transfer_to_lost_baggage"
  },
  {
    "conversation": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "I had some turbulence on my flight" }
    ],
    "function": "None"
  }
]
```

The script 'function_evals.py' will run the evals. Make sure to set `n` to the number
of times you want to run each particular eval. To run the script from the root airline folder, execute:

```bash
cd evals
python3 function_evals.py
```

The results of these evaluations will be stored in `evals/eval_results/`

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.
